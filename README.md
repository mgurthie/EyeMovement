# Project Title: Eye Exercise

**Description:** Create a web page with two eyes that follow your mouse movement. This activity will require you to bring together skills in JavaScript and CSS to create a dynamic experience. 

 
**How to Run:** Simply launch the index.html in your browser and see who gets dizzy first, you or the browser.
 
**Roadmap of future improvements:** Add animation to the eyes so they actually move around the screen always close behind the mouse pointer.
